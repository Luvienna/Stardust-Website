## My Creative Process & What I Learned
My main motivation for this project was to learn how to translate a detailed creative brief into a functioning website. I began by creating a mood board to define the website's tone and aesthetic. This helped me choose a specific color palette and elegant typography to evoke a sense of vintage magic and mystery. I learned how to prioritize visual storytelling to create an enchanting first chapter of the "Stardust & Quill" experience.
